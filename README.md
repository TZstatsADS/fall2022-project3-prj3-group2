+ Project summary: In this project, we created two predictive models based on a training set with 50,000 images in the directory. Model 1 is a more sophisticated model while still treats the noisy labels as clean ones based on the baseline model. The methodology behind the model is transfer learning utilizing VGG16 as a pre-trained model. Model 2 adds some extra models or procedures to address the label noise issue. 

	
**Contribution statement**: Tianyu and Xinyun designed the model . And they developed and improved the baseline of the mode with further engineering the model 1 and model 2 for better and precise accuracy. Xiaoyuan and Ruiyu take care of the design and drawing the power point. Louis take a further look at the ppt and make changes since he is the presenter. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation.And all team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
