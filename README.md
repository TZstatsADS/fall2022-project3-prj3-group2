+ Project summary: In this project, we created two predictive models based on a training set with 50,000 images in the directory. Model 1 is a more sophisticated model while still treats the noisy labels as clean ones based on the baseline model. The methodology behind the model is transfer learning utilizing VGG16 as a pre-trained model. Model 2 adds some extra models or procedures to address the label noise issue.
